# Advanced deep learning, 2022 Fall
This is a graduate-level deep learning course which introduces natural lagnauge processing content from the basics to the cutting-edge techniques. This repository contains my solutions to the homework as well as the final project.

## Course contents
- NN Basics, Backpropagation
- Word representation
- Recurrent neural network
- Word embedding, ELMo
- Attention, transformer
- BERT
- Reinforcement learning: Value-based RL, policy gradient, actor-critic
- Natural langauge generation, perplexity
- Large language model (LLM) pretraining
- Prompt learning on pretrained LM
- Dual learning, self-supervised learning
- GPTs: GPT-3, InstructGPT, ChatGPT, WebGPT
- Multimodal models: CLIP, DALLÂ·E2

## Homework assignments
- HW1
  - Intent classification
  - Slot tagging
- HW2: BERT
- HW3: Natural langauge generations

You could find more details in the directory of each homework.

## Final projects 
- Best oral presentation
